Principal Ideas:
0. Exists several bugtracking systems that provide us a interface to manage reports of maintenance activities. The developers report issues describing how it's wrong in the system and what could be improve. This issues can be called tickets. They are used in Open-Source projects
1. It's difficult can distinguish bug report from feautures. Because sometimes the developer uses the tickets to discuss about some issue
2. We analyze tickets from Launchpad, a web interface of ticket tracking system, to be able to classify them as bug report or not, this way in the bug-seeding process, the developers can be sure that they are trackback a real bug reports and not features.
3. We want to help understanding how classify the bug reports. Bug-fix are normaly submitted as patches, this patches usually are linked to the bug using the ID of the bug report. 
4. The misclassification provoques bias predicting bugs, so we need be sure that the ticket is a bug report.
5. The accuracy in the results of bug-seeding depends on the quality of the data.
6. why OpenStack? The OpenStack project was particularly of interest because of its highest scope and heterogeneous nature with hundreds of developers contributing, futhermore due to its short life, only 5 yesar, all its history is saved and available in a version control system.
 
LITERATURE:
* Is it a Bug or an Enhancement? A Text-based Approach to Classify Change Requests tcription of the ticke--> classify tickets as bug or non bugs using automatic classification system.: How Misclassification impacts Bug Prediction:
* I's Not a Bug, It's a Feauture --> Disscused the impact of the misclassification, they found tahta two of five issues was misclassified through 5 different proyects. They recomend data validation in the studies.
\section{Methods} 
\label{sec:1}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
We extract randomly 125 hundred tickets from the four principal repositories in OpenStack, analysing manually a total of 500 tickets reported in the last year. This tickets could be tagged as either "Fix Commited" or "Fix Released" to be able to localizate the patch implemented into de source code, and are generally tracked in Launchpad \texttt{Nova}\footnote{\url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova}}, \texttt{Cinder}\footnote{\url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder}}, \texttt{Horizon}\footnote{\url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon}} and \texttt{Neutron}\footnote{\url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron}}.

The parameters analyzed for each ticket were the title and the description of the report and the description of the fix commit, also the code changes if neither the descriptions and the comments clarified the underlying tiket. Each ticket was then categorized into one of three following groups.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The ticket describes a bug report.
  \item The ticket describes a feature, an optimitazion code, changes in test files or other not bug reports.
  \item The ticket presents a vague description and cannot be classified without doubts. 
\end{enumerate}

Henceforth, we will refer to Group 1 as \textit{Bug Report}, Gruop 2 as \textit{not Bug Report} and Group 3 as \textit{Undecided}.

Three different people analysed 167 tickets using a double bind, that way, all of the tickets were analyzed by two developers.Each developer analyzed 167 tickets and the half tickets of his teammates. At the end, they disscusing the classification conflicts arising a best classification.

Explain the classification rules:
A ticket is classified as bug report if:
- The sistem doesn't work as the developer though.
- the sistem logs a error
- the sistem fails.

A ticket is classified as non bug report if:
- It's a feature, 
- It only has test files involved
- It's describing an optimization.
